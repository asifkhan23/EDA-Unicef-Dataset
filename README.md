# EDA-Unicef-Dataset

UNICEF works in over 190 countries and territories to save children’s lives, to defend their rights, and to help them fulfill their potential, from early childhood through adolescence. And we never give up.

Taking the idea from UNICEF’s mission statement, we are trying to visualize the five goals of UNCIEF which they are committed towards achieving.

Five Goals of UNICEF:
1. Every child has an Equitable chance in life - 1 in 4 births of the global population of children under 5 have never been registered
2. Every child is protected from violence and exploitation - More than 2 in 3 children are subjected to violent discipline by caregivers
3. Every child learns - More than 175 million children do not have access to Pre-Primary education
4. Every child lives in a clean and safe environment - 3 billion people do not have handwashing facility with water and soap at home
5. Every child survives and thrives - 5.2 million children under the age of 5 died in 2019

For visualizing these goals we have selected The Least Developed Countries as we believe it is more important to understand the impact of UNICEF in these nations.
