## Introduction

UNICEF works in over 190 countries and territories to save children’s lives, to defend their rights, and to help them fulfill their potential, from early childhood through adolescence. And we never give up.

Taking the idea from UNICEF’s mission statement, we are trying to visualize the five goals of UNCIEF which they are committed towards achieving.

Five Goals of UNICEF:
1. Every child has an Equitable chance in life - 1 in 4 births of the global population of children under 5 have never been registered
2. Every child is protected from violence and exploitation - More than 2 in 3 children are subjected to violent discipline by caregivers
3. Every child learns - More than 175 million children do not have access to Pre-Primary education
4. Every child lives in a clean and safe environment - 3 billion people do not have handwashing facility with water and soap at home
5. Every child survives and thrives - 5.2 million children under the age of 5 died in 2019

For visualizing these goals we have selected The Least Developed Countries as we believe it is more important to understand the impact of UNICEF in these nations.

## Conclusion

The 5 major goal areas span a child’s life cycle, encompassing antenatal care, through infancy, childhood and adolescence, giving priority to the most disadvantaged children. Equity for children is both a stand-alone goal and a cross-cutting priority. The results areas target the key barriers that hold children and young people back, deny them the agency to shape their destinies and prevent them from accessing critical services that can save their lives and help them fulfil their potential.

From our understanding of the visualizations in least developed countries, we can say UNICEF has created a a positive impact in areas such as improving literacy rate, reducing infant mortality rate, and increasing the life expectancy by providing better sanitation and clean drinking water services. However, there are a few areas such as protecting female from violence, providing more awareness about nutrition in chlid, HIV, and seeking higher education where UNICEF can create a stronger impact.
